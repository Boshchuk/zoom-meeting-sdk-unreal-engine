# Zoom Meeting SDK Unreal Engine

## Description

The Zoom Meeting SDK for Unreal Engine lets you combine Zoom’s meeting and webinar functionality with Epic’s Unreal Engine to create games, industrial applications, or live experiences that leverage powerful 3D rendering and interaction capabilities. Extend Zoom functionality into Unreal’s C++ and Blueprints development environments with the Meeting SDK. Zoom’s live video feeds can be directly provided to your Unreal Engine levels, and you can capture your scene to provide a video return feed from Unreal to Zoom.

This open source wrapper exposes more than 300 Meeting SDK functions to Unreal Engine, including extensive Blueprint support. From basic meeting controls to raw video data, it allows anyone - with code experience or not - to integrate Zoom workflows within Unreal Engine. 

Find more details and information, including a full Unreal Engine sample project with a Zoom 3D virtual gallery driven by Blueprints along with code examples, compilation instructions and more in our developer docs.
